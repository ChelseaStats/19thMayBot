#####  19thMayBot

> A twitter bot that live tweets the Champions League final of May 19th 2012

###### Notes

The commentary-log.csv contains the order of tweets (text), the time offset (the bot sleeps for x minutes after tweet before the next one).

The Twitter API allows for 250 calls per rolling 24 hour period. so the CSV file should have no more than 200 rows.

The text in the file should not be more than 140 characters (otherwise twitter won't publish it).

Feel free to contribute ( add more details, correct typos, and general improvements).
